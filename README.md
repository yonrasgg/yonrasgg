## 🧭 Who I Am

I’m an **independent, self-taught technologist** focused on building **secure, scalable, and observable systems**.

I don’t define myself by job titles or corporate labels.  
I define myself by **what I can design, automate, harden, and operate**.

My work lives at the intersection of:
- DevSecOps
- Infrastructure & automation
- Security-by-design
- Open-source experimentation
- Reproducible knowledge systems

Security is not a blocker — **it’s an enabler when designed correctly**.

---

## 🏗️ What I Build

- Security-first platforms
- DevSecOps pipelines & hardened infrastructure
- Automation-heavy, auditable systems
- Proof-of-concepts that evolve into production systems
- Labs and experiments that feed real-world implementations

I learn by building, validating, breaking, and rebuilding — **in public whenever possible**.

---

## 🧠 Working Philosophy

- **Secure by default**, not patched later
- **Evidence over assumptions**
- **Automation over manual processes**
- **Open-source aligned**
- **Documentation is part of the system**
- **If it can’t be reproduced, it’s not finished**

I operate with a hacker mindset — curious, critical, hands-on — while remaining ethical, disciplined, and professional.
